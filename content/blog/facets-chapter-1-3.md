## Welcome to Facets

A good friend of mine often re-watches/rereads media he thoroughly enjoys and when he does he likes to write about it, taking a lot of joy in the process. Something like this interested me but never enough to do something like it. 

However he recently retried to watch the anime adaptation of Land of the Lustrous, and while he was unable to enjoy the story the first time, the promise of the latter parts of the series interested him and led him to finish the first season enjoying it more than expected. As an ardent fan of the Land of the Lustrous manga I asked if he'd join me in a challenge. Much like the dissections he enjoys, we will be reading 3 chapters a week and writing our thoughts down somewhere. I decided to go a little overboard and created this blog for that purpose.

## Preface

A few things I would like to say before I continue, most importantly would be my referring to the lustrous with female pronouns. I refer to the lustrous with she/her pronouns, this is canonically incorrect, gems are non-binary. If you take comfort or joy in the fact that they are non-binary I'm not trying to stop you and I encourage it. It is something I do out of habit as when I was introduced to the series this was my learned way to refer to them.

The fact that gems are gender-less and yet are shaped in a feminine form may even be a point of analysis in future.

As for spoilers, I will attempt to not spoil any chapters beyond the ones I cover in an article, but I may allude to later events.

A few miscellaneous details, I am reading the manga physically where I can from my own collection published by Kodansha and will be using scans from a convenient source for my posts. When using artwork from outside the manga I will try to contact the artist for permission and at the very least link to their social media.

## The First Page

Like many manga, Land of the Lustrous opens with a full-colour illustration. Attention grabbing colours and fantastical art to draw the reader in is essential as this is both the first impression and an expensive luxury. Often manga open in medias res because of this, displaying powerful imagery of intense emotion, however this manga is a little different as this is how the colour page is used.

This is quite striking, not only is Phos, our main character, obscured in a small amount of space in the panels but she is also given a first impression of being aloof and unmotivated.

I feel this sets up the story well, Phos is a character that in many, many ways does not fit into the rules of the world she is born into. That's quite a vague statement! But it'll take quite a few more volumes to truly explore that, for now let's move onto the first three chapters.

## Chapters 1-3: Phosphophyllite, Cinnabar and Diamond

Phos carries herself with a gleeful and carefree attitude, others seem inconvenienced and sometimes annoyed by her presence which they see as interfering with their duties. It is clear from her interactions with Sensei and the other gems that Phos is struggling to find her profession, and despite many failures he continues to search for one for her. Phos is weak and fragile, by no fault of her own, she was born that way. It is clear from the start that despite her cheer, she hides her pain and tries to find a way to overcome this wishing to be different.

Duty is important to the society of the gems many characters are introduced, and at first defined by, their duties. Duty and the ability to fulfill them has become the most respectable trait a gem can have, possibly due to Sensei's insistence upon it, and no duty is more respected than those who fight. Fighting is the ambition of Phos for this reason, she deeply craves respect and gets nothing but contempt or pity. This society has developed a toxic meritocracy due to this, with gems valuing fighting ability and hardness above all else, to the point that they even judge each other using a numerical scale to pull rank seemingly.

Constantly, the gems compare themselves to each other, trying to outdo each other. Diamond is beautiful, popular and excellent at fighting, yet even she is wishes her close friend Bort gone simply because their existence means she is second in fighting ability.

While Phos struggles to come to terms with a job she considers useless, she meets Cinnabar. Cinnabar acts as a foil for Phos, sharing many qualities but highlighting their differences. Like Phos, Cinnabar is physically weak, is a misfit in the society, craves love and respect and deeply longs for change, this meeting along with Diamond a chapter later catalyzes Phos' development as a character.

Confronted with the realization that there is someone else who struggles as she does, Phos has the polar opposite reaction to the situation as Cinnabar. Cinnabar has given up, she wants nothing more than to be taken by the lunarians despite being given a job only she can do. Phos asks her to help her with her task, and from what we have seen so far we can hardly blame Cinnabar when she dismisses Phos as selfishly looking out for her own interests. But before Cinnabar can say anything else, Phos promises to find her a new job, one that only she can do and far more fun. In a meritocracy there is little use in helping each other, disarmingly it seems that Phos has a genuine interest in helping Cinnabar.

From what Rutile says of Cinnabar it is clear why the lustrous place such importance on their duties. They are immortal beings that seek purpose in their own lives where there seemingly is none, the peaceful option left for them is to use duties as a surrogate for meaning in their lives. Those who can do their duties best earn the respect, and the only way that many can deal with not being in that position is to pass their own self-doubts onto their lessers. Phos as the weakest is free from this hierarchy, and in the perfect position to change it.
