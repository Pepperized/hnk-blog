## Welcome to Facets

A good friend of mine often rewatches/rereads media he thoroughly enjoys and when he does he likes to write about it, taking a lot of joy in the process. Something like this interested me but never enough to do something like it. 

However he recently retried to watch the anime adaptation of Land of the Lustrous, and while he was unable to enjoy the story the first time, the promise of the latter parts of the series interested him and led him to finish the first season enjoying it more than expected. As an ardent fan of the Land of the Lustrous manga I asked if he'd join me in a challenge. Much like the dissections he enjoys, we will be reading 3 chapters a week and writing our thoughts down somewhere. I decided to go a little overboard and created this blog for that purpose.

## Preface

A few things I would like to say before I continue, most importantly would be my referring to the lustrous with female pronouns. I refer to the lustrous with she/her pronouns, this is canonically incorrect, gems are non-binary. If you take comfort or joy in the fact that they are non-binary I'm not trying to stop you and I encourage it. It is something I do out of habit as when I was introduced to the series this was my learned way to refer to them.

The fact that gems are gender-less and yet are shaped in a feminine form may even be a point of analysis in future.

Next a few miscellaneous details, I am reading the manga physically where I can from my own collection published by Kodansha and will be using scans from a convenient source for my posts. When using artwork from outside the manga I will try to contact the artist for permission and at the very least link to their social media.
